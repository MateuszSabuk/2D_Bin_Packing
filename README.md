# 2D Bin Packing Solver
Project for my university Optimization Algorithms course

## Objectives

Create a visual solver for 2D Bin Packing Problem

### Algorithms to implement

- Two-phase algorithms
  - [x] Hybrid First-Fit (HFF)
  - [x] Hybrid Next-Fit (HNF)
  - [ ] Hybrid Best-Fit (HBF)
  - [ ] Floor-Ceiling (FC) algorithm
- One-phase algorithms
  - [ ] Finite Next-Fit (FNF)
  - [ ] Finite First-Fit (FFF)
  - [ ] Finite Bottom-left (FBL)
  - [ ] Next Bottom-left (NBL)
  - [ ] Alternate Directions (AD)

## Modules to implement

- [x] 2D box generator
- [x] Bin size generator
- [x] Algorithm choice
- [ ] Fill percentage indicator
- [x] Graphical controls and visualization

Also nice to have:
- Time slider to display the order of packing
- Ranking of the algorithms
